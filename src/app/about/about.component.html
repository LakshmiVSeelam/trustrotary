                    <li>The number 16 resonates with wisdom, independence, and family. 16 is a number of  introspection. It is wise, intuitive, and tends to be independent. 
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Hence the 16 spokes</span></li>
                    <li>Blood globally represents life itself, as the element of divine life that functions within the human body closely tied with passion, but also with death, war & sacrifice. <span class="font-weight-bold">Hence the drop of blood emoji</span></li>
                    <li>Physiotherapy encompasses rehabilitation, injury prevention and health promotion. It's the spine, or backbone of active and healthy life. More often than not physiotherapy helps prevent major Surgeries. 
                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Hence the human with backbone emoji</span></li>
                    <li>The hand that cares is holier than the lips that pray. Skill development is a vital tool to empower people, to safeguard their future and for the overall development of an individual and it needs motherly care for improving expertise in different fields of knowledge. <span class="font-weight-bold">Hence the hand emoji.</span></li>
